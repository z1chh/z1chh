/**
 * Notes on Classes:
 * 
 * Card Class:
 * The 52 standard Cards are being initialized as global variables (declared after the Card class).
 * As required, Rank::ACE is attributed the value 1. Nothing was specified for the Type enums, so I set the first enum to value 1 as well.
 * The getValue method sets Aces to be worth 11 points by default.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Hand Class:
 * The Hand constructor creates an array of Card pointers (size of 12).
 * This array is set to static so it doesnt get destroyed at the end of the initialization of a Hand object.
 * The getTotal method sets the value of Aces to 1 (instead of the default 11) ONLY if the Hand is currently busting.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Deck Class:
 * The Deck constructor creates an array of Card pointers (size of 52).
 * This array is set to static so it doesnt get destroyed at the end of the initialization of a Deck object.
 * 
 * The deal() method takes the Card on top of the Deck (last element of the array), but does not actually remove it.
 * In fact, from now on, we consider the previous Card as the last Card of the Deck.
 * 
 * The shuffle() method swaps two randomly selected Cards until all Cards (or 1 Card is left, if the Deck has odd size) are swapped.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * HumanPlayer Class:
 * The isDrawing method() makes sure the user entered a valid input (y/n). Otherwise, we ask the question again (instead of assuming no).
 * However, if the user enters an invalid input 10 times in a row, THEN we assume they stop drawing.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Other Notes:
 * Encapsulation of Data:
 * To avoid any form of cheating from the user, Card fields are private and no methods are provided to change them.
 * Furthermore, the Hand and Deck classes only use Card objects that have been created beforehand.
 * Thus, the only way for the user to introduce new Cards is by creating new Card objects, but the Hand and Deck classes will never use the newly created Card objects.
 * Such immutability allows the preservation of encapsulation and avoids information leaking.
 * 
 * 
 * Proper Calculation of the Ace Value:
 * I set the default value of the Ace to 11 since it allows the Player to get a bigger number (closer to 21).
 * However, if this causes the Player to bust, I set its value down to 1 point (Hand::getTotal() method).
 * This is, in my opinion, the best way to attribute a value to Aces to suit the Player best.
 * 
 * Differences Between Provided main() and Expected Output:
 * The provided main() and the expected output are different (for example, main() couts "Blackjack game" instead of "Blackjack table" and main() couts more "\n"s and "\t").
 * Thus, I slightly modified the main() so that it matches the expected output.
