My first basic website using HTML and CSS. Learned and implemented basic HTML features for the skeleton of the webpage.

Used external CSS code to style the website instead of using HTML.

Used containers to get the text to stay centered and within a margin (width 80%), and separated each section of the webpage with their own IDs.

Used a picture for the showcase section, and made the page interactive such that the showcase image extends if the window is shrunk. The sidebar also goes under the main text if the width goes below 600 pixels for easier readability (not floating anymore).

The first page of the website is index.html, and the CSS is in CSS/style.css.
