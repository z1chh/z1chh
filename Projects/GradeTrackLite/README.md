## Note

Note: the code for this project is in the [GradeTrackLite repository](https://github.com/z1chh/gradetracklite).

## Application

This is an online platform designed to assist schools or student groups in managing and monitoring their academic grades. It offers a viable solution for educational institutions that don't currently have a specific grade tracking system, simplifying the process significantly. This tool also enables students to conveniently access their grades in one place, eliminating the need to physically store and organize their assignments and tests at home.

## Software Privacy

This web application places a strong emphasis on privacy and minimizes the collection of personally identifiable information (PII). It's built on a privacy-by-design framework, meaning we've integrated privacy considerations into every aspect of its design and operation. User information is limited to what's absolutely necessary for the service to function. Any data collected is anonymized and encrypted to ensure that personal details remain confidential. We abide by stringent data retention policies, removing information once it's no longer needed. Furthermore, we provide users with control over their data, offering clear and straightforward methods for viewing, updating, or deleting their information whenever they wish. This approach ensures that we uphold the highest standards of privacy while providing a practical and secure tool for grade management.

## Self-Hosting

This web application offers the option of self-hosting, providing a high degree of flexibility and control. For instance, a school can set up its own server to run this application if they don't currently have a system in place for tracking grades. Self-hosting allows the school to maintain full control over data security, access, and management. It also ensures that the application can be tailored to meet the specific needs of the institution and its students. This flexibility makes it a perfect fit for schools seeking a customizable and secure solution for grade tracking.
