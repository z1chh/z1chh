## Note
Note: the code for this project is in the [HTML-Basics repository](https://github.com/z1chh/HTML-Basics).

## My Website
My first basic website using HTML. Learned and implemented basic HTML features such as page organization (head and body, nav, main and footer, etc) and containers (divs, spans, forms) with basic metadata.

Separated code cleanly with indentations, and files for each page of the website.

Used elements such as hyperlinks, inputs, pictures and videos, lists, tables, along with some basic formatting and styling.

The first page of the website is index.html.
