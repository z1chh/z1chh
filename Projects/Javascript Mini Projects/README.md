# Javascript Basics

## Note
Note: the code for this project is in the [Javascript-Mini-Projects repository](https://github.com/z1chh/JavaScript-Mini-Projects).

Here is a list of simple Javascript projects that I implemented.

## [Counter](https://github.com/z1chh/JavaScript-Mini-Projects/tree/main/Counter)

A simple counter that can be incremented or resetted to 0 using two buttons.

## [Basket-Ball Scoreboard](https://github.com/z1chh/JavaScript-Mini-Projects/tree/main/Basketball%20Scoreboard)

A basket-ball scoreboard to keep track of each team's score. The winning team's score is highlighted.

It also contains a 24s timer that glows when there is only one second left (resets after a team score).

The `New Game` button resets the scores and the timer.

## [Stopwatch](https://github.com/z1chh/JavaScript-Mini-Projects/tree/main/Stopwatch)

A simple stopwatch that keeps track of time. The reset button sets it back to 0, and also stops the timer.

## [Clock](https://github.com/z1chh/JavaScript-Mini-Projects/tree/main/Clock)

A simple digital clock that displays the time (EST Time).

## [Calculator](https://github.com/z1chh/JavaScript-Mini-Projects/tree/main/Calculator)

A simple calculator that performs basic computations.

### Rules

The following rules are applied:

- First input is calculated first (no PEMDAS)
- `%` sets the current input in percentage (divides by 100)
- `+/-` negates the current input
- If the first input of the equation is an operator, it will be ignored (note: to obtain a negative number, use the `+/-` button and not the `-` button)
- If an operator is entered when the previous input was also an operator, the previous input is overwritten
- If the equation ends with an operator, the equation is considered as invalid and `NaN` is returned
- `AC` resets the calculator (no `C` button to clear last input only)
- Once `=` is clicked, the equation is computed. Clicking on `=` again does nothing

## [Color Guesser](https://github.com/z1chh/JavaScript-Mini-Projects/tree/main/Color%20Guesser)

A color guessing game with different difficulties.


## [Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/z1chh/JavaScript-Mini-Projects/tree/main/Tic%20Tac%20Toe)

A Tic Tac Toe game. It can be played against another human, or a computer. The computer plays randomly.
