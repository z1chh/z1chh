- 👋 z1chh here! I am a student at McGill University learning about computer science.

- 👀 I love to apply the knowledge that I have learned and possess a strong desire to learn more about the many aspects of computer science. I am always trying to explore more abilities and skills in order to further my efficiency in this domain and to excel in this field, as a programmer.

- 🌱 I'm currently learning front-end (HTML, CSS, JS, React & Angular) and more about neural networks (machine learning).

- 💞️ I am really interested in making games and artificial intelligence. Here are some projects that I really enjoyed doing.

Programming isn't about what you know; it's about what you can figure out.
